			<div class="hello">
			<p style="font-family: Times New Roman">Hello! I am Kateryna.</p>
			</div>
			<p style="font-family: Times New Roman">I am a 16-year-old student from Kherson, a southern town in Ukraine. I am an artist, a writer, a journalist and a coffee lover.</p>
			<p style="font-family: Times New Roman">Art is the lens through which I view the world. I am most passionate about photography, creative writing, music, and drawing, but I constantly explore new ways to express my thoughts and emotions. My journey in the arts is also driven by a desire to help others see and understand the beauty of the world and the complexities of human nature. </p>
			<p style="font-family: Times New Roman">In journalism, I love to explore the narrow field of social advertisements and their impact on humans. Also, I learn and practice to conduct surveys and interviews and writing in different kinds of journalistic genres as a part of my journalism classes. When exploring social advertisements, I have done three scholarly researches: “Social Advertisement at the Time of Covid 19: types, theme, functions”, “Social Advertisement at the Time of War: theme, structure, visuals”, and “Social screen advertising in the conditions of war: topics, strategies, modern cases”. </p>
			<p style="font-family: Times New Roman">Apart from journalism, I am actively taking an interest in and participating in academic Olympiads in subjects such as Ukrainian language and literature, English, Math, World Literature, and History. </p>
			<p style="font-family: Times New Roman">I am also a member of the Student Government and a volunteer. </p>
			<p style="font-family: Times New Roman">For fun, I love reading, cross-stitching, playing chess, and listening to podcasts/watching educational videos on various topics. In my free time, I am learning more about coding and experimenting with it, like creating this website :) </p>
